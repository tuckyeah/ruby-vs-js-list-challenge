# Ruby vs. JavaScript: List Challenge

List processing is a very common task in applied computer science. Ruby and
JavaScript both have good list processing facilities, but they differ quite a
bit. This challenge requires you to solve the same two problems in both Ruby and
JavaScript.

## Prerequisites

-   [ga-wdi-boston/js-array-methods](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/js-array-methods)
-   [ga-wdi-boston/ruby-vs-js-arrays](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/ruby-vs-js-arrays)

## Instructions

1.  Fork and clone this repository.
1.  Change into the new directory.
1.  Install dependencies.
1.  Create and checkout a new branch to work on.
1.  Fulfill the listed requirements.

Do your work in [`lib/challenge.js`](lib/challenge.js) and
[`lib/challenge.rb`](lib/challenge.rb). A pull request is not required, but it
is necessary if you want a code review.

You may wish to refer to [FAQs](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/meta/wiki/)
related to [forking,
cloning](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/meta/wiki/ForkAndClone).

## Requirements

Complete these exercises in both Ruby and Python:

-   [True for Any?](http://www.codewars.com/kata/enumerable-magic-number-2-true-for-any)
-   [True for None?](http://www.codewars.com/kata/enumerable-magic-number-4-true-for-none)

You should be running `grunt nag` before diagnosing any bugs, since it finds
some of the most common sources of errors.

## Bonus

Complete the previous exercises in Python.

Complete the following exercises in Ruby, JavaScript, and Python:

-   [True for Just One?](http://www.codewars.com/kata/enumerable-magic-number-5-true-for-just-one)
-   [True for All?](http://www.codewars.com/kata/enumerable-magic-number-1-true-for-all)
